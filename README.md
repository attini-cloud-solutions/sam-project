# sam-project
A minimal project for a distribution using SAM. All contents in the hello-world-app folder is generated by
the SAM CLI. It is present for demonstration purposes only and should be replaced.

The hello-world-app is not prebuilt (by running the ``sam build`` command), therefore this project will need the SAM CLI installed for packaging in to a distribution.
